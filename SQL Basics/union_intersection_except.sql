-- SQL Topic: Unions, Intersections & Exceptions
-- When working with multiple tables, the UNION and UNION ALL operator allows you to append the results of one query to another assuming that they have the same column count, order and data type. If you use the UNION without the ALL, duplicate rows between the tables will be removed from the result.

-- Select query with set operators
SELECT column, another_column
   FROM mytable
UNION / UNION ALL / INTERSECT / EXCEPT
SELECT other_column, yet_another_column
   FROM another_table
ORDER BY column DESC
LIMIT n;
-- In the order of operations as defined in Lesson 12: Order of execution, the UNION happens before the ORDER BY and LIMIT. It's not common to use UNIONs, but if you have data in different tables that can't be joined and processed, it can be an alternative to making multiple queries on the database.

-- Similar to the UNION, the INTERSECT operator will ensure that only rows that are identical in both result sets are returned, and the EXCEPT operator will ensure that only rows in the first result set that aren't in the second are returned. This means that the EXCEPT operator is query order-sensitive, like the LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

-- Both INTERSECT and EXCEPT also discard duplicate rows after their respective operations, though some databases also support INTERSECT ALL and EXCEPT ALL to allow duplicates to be retained and returned.
