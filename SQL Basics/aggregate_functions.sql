-- SQL Aggregate Functions
-- SQL Aggregate Functions
-- An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

-- Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.

-- The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

-- MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
-- MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
-- COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
-- SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
-- AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column
-- Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).
