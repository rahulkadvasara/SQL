-- The SQL BACKUP DATABASE Statement
-- The BACKUP DATABASE statement is used in SQL Server to create a full back up of an existing SQL database.

-- Syntax
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath';

-- The SQL BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Statement
-- A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup.
-- Syntax
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;

-- BACKUP DATABASE Example
-- The following SQL statement creates a full back up of the existing database "testDB" to the D disk:

-- ExampleGet your own SQL Server
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak';
-- Tip: Always back up the database to a different drive than the actual database. Then, if you get a disk crash, you will not lose your backup file along with the database.


-- The following SQL statement creates a differential back up of the database "testDB":
-- Example
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
-- Tip: A differential back up reduces the back up time (since only the changes are backed up).
