-- SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
-- In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

-- A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

-- You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

-- A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement. 

-- CREATE VIEW Syntax
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.

-- SQL CREATE VIEW Examples
-- The following SQL creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil:

-- ExampleGet your own SQL Server
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
-- We can query the view above as follows:

-- Example
SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];

-- The following SQL creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price:

-- Example
CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);

-- We can query the view above as follows:

-- Example
SELECT * FROM [Products Above Average Price];

-- SQL Updating a View

-- A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.

-- SQL CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- The following SQL adds the "City" column to the "Brazil Customers" view:

-- Example
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- SQL Dropping a View
-- A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW statement.

-- SQL DROP VIEW Syntax
DROP VIEW view_name;

-- The following SQL drops the "Brazil Customers" view:

-- Example
DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];
